This project was made to automate the sponsor process. You will need to edit the linksCompany file to include the name
of the companies you want to email and the links to those companies. You can then run the emailScraper file (python3 emailScraper.py), then
run the emailSender file (python3 emailSender.py) after the emailScraper file is finished.

This project was made by me (Joshua) and Ashwin (:
